# **Data Engineering**

1. **Integrating Salesforce API with Azure Data Factory**
Developing data pipelines and data products by integrating Salesforce API with Azure Data Factory involves several detailed steps. Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step guide:

#### Prerequisites:
1. Pre-requisite
   - Salesforce Account(with necessary permissions or create a Salesforce developer account if needed.
2. Azure Account:
   - Account with access to Azure Data Factory.

### How to create a data pipeline?

#### **1. Create a Connected App in Salesforce:**
   a. Log in to Salesforce.  
   b. Navigate to Setup > App Manager > New Connected App.  
   c. Fill in required details, including Callback URL.  
   d. Note down the generated Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.  

#### **2. Obtain Salesforce User Credentials:**
   a. Retrieve Salesforce username and password.  
   b. Ensure the Salesforce account has API access.  
   c. Generate a Security Token for the user.  

#### **3. Set Up Linked Service in Azure Data Factory:**
   a. In Azure Portal, navigate to Azure Data Factory.  
   b. Create a new Linked Service for Salesforce.  
   c. Configure the Linked Service with the Salesforce API endpoint, Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Username, Password, and Security Token.  

#### **4. Define Datasets in Azure Data Factory:**  
   a. Create datasets representing source and destination data structures.  
   b. Utilize Salesforce datasets to read data from Salesforce and other datasets for storing data in Azure services (e.g., Azure SQL Database).  

#### **5. Build Pipelines:**
   a. Create pipelines to orchestrate data movement.  
   b. Use the "Copy Data" activity to copy data between Salesforce and Azure.  
   c. Configure the source and destination settings in the Copy Data activity.  
   d. Implement data mapping if required.  

#### **6. Data Transformation (Optional):**
   a. If data transformation is needed, create an Azure Data Flow within the pipeline.  
   b. Apply transformations such as filtering, mapping, or aggregating data.  

#### **7. Error Handling and Logging:**  
   a. Implement error handling mechanisms in the pipeline.  
   b. Utilize logging activities or Azure Monitor for tracking pipeline execution and identifying issues.  

#### **8. Testing:**
   a. Thoroughly test the pipeline with different scenarios.  
   b. Test various data types and volumes to ensure scalability.  
   c. Address any data integrity or mapping issues.  

#### **9. Scheduling and Triggering:**
   a. Set up schedules or triggers to run the pipeline at specified intervals.  
   b. Consider using triggers based on events (e.g., file arrival, database changes) for real-time integration.  

#### **10. Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   a. Monitor pipeline executions through Azure Data Factory Monitoring.  
   b. Establish alerting for critical issues.  
   c. Regularly review and update the pipeline to accommodate changes in data structures or business requirements.  

#### **11. Documentation:**
   a. Document the pipeline configurations, dataset structures, and any specific configurations.  
   b. Include information on credentials and access management.  

2. **Implementing data mapping during building a pipeline to move Salesforce data to Azure**

### Step 1: Understand the Salesforce Data Structure

1. **Identify Objects:**
   - Understand the Salesforce objects you want to migrate.
   - Common objects might include Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, etc.

2. **Review Fields:**
   - Take note of the fields within each object.
   - Understand data types (text, number, date) and any relationships.

### Step 2: Define Azure Data Storage

1. **Choose Azure Storage:**
   - Determine the Azure data storage solution (Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake Storage, etc.).

2. **Create Tables/Containers:**
   - Create tables or containers in Azure corresponding to Salesforce objects.

### Step 3: Data Mapping

1. **Field-Level Mapping:**
   - Map Salesforce fields to Azure table/container columns.
   - Consider data type compatibility and transformations if needed.

2. **Handle Relationships:**
   - If there are parent-child relationships in Salesforce, map them to corresponding relationships in Azure.

### Step 4: Choose Integration Tool

1. **Select Integration Service:**
   - Choose an integration service compatible with both Salesforce and Azure (e.g., Azure Data Factory, Informatica, Talend).

2. **Configure Source and Destination Connections:**
   - Set up connections to Salesforce as the source and Azure as the destination.

### Step 5: Build Data Pipeline

1. **Create Pipeline:**
   - Use the chosen integration tool to create a data pipeline.

2. **Define Source and Destination:**
   - Specify Salesforce as the source and Azure as the destination in the pipeline.

3. **Apply Data Mapping:**
   - Implement the data mapping by configuring field-level mappings within the pipeline.

### Step 6: Handle Incremental Loads

1. **Identify Changes:**
   - Determine how to identify new or updated records in Salesforce since the last migration.

2. **Implement Incremental Logic:**
   - Modify the pipeline to handle incremental loads by only migrating changed records.

### Step 7: Test the Pipeline

1. **Run Sample Data:**
   - Run the pipeline with a subset of data for testing purposes.

2. **Verify Results:**
   - Ensure that data is successfully transferred from Salesforce to Azure.
   - Check for accurate data mapping and any errors in the process.

### Step 8: Monitor and Schedule

1. **Set Up Monitoring:**
   - Configure monitoring to track the pipeline's performance and errors.

2. **Schedule Pipeline:**
   - Set up a schedule for running the pipeline, considering Salesforce API limits and data freshness requirements.

### Step 9: Document the Solution

1. **Documentation:**
   - Document the data mapping, pipeline configurations, and any transformation logic applied.

2. **Provide Maintenance Instructions:**
   - Include instructions for maintaining and updating the pipeline as needed.
